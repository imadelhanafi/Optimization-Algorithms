# Optimization Algorithms

In this project we want to solve numerically an optimization problem with constraints.

### Structure

This project is devided into two parts : 

* **Optimizer** - Implementation of optimization algorithms : Newton and Generalized Newton using SQP (Sequential Quadratic Programming).
* **Simulator** - Calculate necessary parameters (from a real problem) that will be used as inputs in the optimizer.

### Problem
Our goal is to find the position of static equilibrium of a chain formed of rigid bars in a vertical plane.

Inputs of this problems (defined in ch.m) are:

* LB : Lengths of bars
* xy : position of the nodes
* (a,b) : Position of end node, knowing that the other extremity is at (0,0)
* Max-iteration : max iteration allowed in the optimization algorithms
* Tolerance : Error tolerance allowed
* imode : choice of the optimization algorithms

The following figure represents a chain (black points are nodes):
